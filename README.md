This website has been created for my 3rd milestone, data centric project. 

The site created is a fictional recipe sharing buisness set up by a group of fictional mums, I chose the theme as a mum of a mixed Gluten Free/Normal family so I could relate to the subject I wanted to convey.

Users can register for a free account and then share recipes with other users, they can also edit or delete their recipes and if they've had enough they can delete their account.

## Introduction
-------------------

### Website Purpose :

* For users to share gluten free recipes
* Allow users to create a account
* Allow users to edit and delete recipes
* Provide information about being gluten free
* Let users know the background to the creation of the site

### Key considerations :

* All recipes must be gluten free, with clear images and instructions
* Website to be bright and colourful but still soft/easy on the eye not garish
* Images to be bright, colourful and relevant
* Layout & content to be child friendly for family to view together

## User Experience (UX)
------------------------

### First time user goals :

* Easily understand the purpose of the website

### Returning/Frequent user goals:

* View recipes and search recipes

### Future considerations :

* Add ratings to each recipe for user to visually identify which recipe is good
* Feedback section - area for user to feedback on site and/or recipes
* Blog for any new GF products/news or events that are relevant

## Design
----------

### Colours:

* I used primary colours and kept it bright so it would grab the attention of children but not so bright it would be off putting for adults
* I wanted the colours to be bright and to appeal to children, to keep their interest when viewing the site with a parent

### Images:

* All non-recipe images were chosen because they were bright, followed the chosen colour scheme and had relevant content 
* Recipe images were sourced from [bbc good food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/)
* Non-recipe images were sourced from [unspalsh](https://unsplash.com/) and [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
 

### Logo: 
* I used [Jimdo](https://www.jimdo.com/) to create my company logos
* I used cartoon images of children and primary colours to keep with the theme of the site
* I used [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) to create my favicon for the site
