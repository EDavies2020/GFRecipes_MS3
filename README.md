This website has been created for my 3rd milestone, data centric project. 

The site created is a fictional recipe sharing buisness set up by a group of fictional mums, I chose the theme as a mum of a mixed Gluten Free/Normal family so I could relate to the subject I wanted to convey.

Users can register for a free account and then share recipes with other users, they can also edit or delete their recipes and if they've had enough they can delete their account.
