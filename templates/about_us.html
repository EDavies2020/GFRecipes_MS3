        <p>Gluten Free Kids was created for parents of children who have a gluten free diet</p>
        <p>Those of you who follow a gluten free diet know how tricky when your kids come home from school<br>
            or a party asking for the same tasty treats all their freinds have had.</p>
        <p>As parents we all know how hard it is to plan dinner every night without having dietary requirements<br>
            thrown into the mix.</p>
        <p>We created this site for parents to share gluten free recipes that they and their kids enjoy with other families<br>
            looking for new things to try.</p>
        <p>If you have other adults/children in your household who enjoy your gluten free treats then even better!</p>
        <h5 class="red-text text-darken-4">What is Gluten Free?</h5>
        <p>There is lots of information online about what it means to be gluten free.
            Here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet">wikipedia</a> definition and also a<br>
            a link to <a href="https://www.coeliac.org.uk/information-and-support/living-gluten-free/the-gluten-free-diet/about-gluten/">Coeliac UK</a><br>
            for you to learn more about it.
