# Errors/Warnings HTML <a name="html"></a>


I have a number of errors and warnings that I was unable to resolve as they relate directly to the Jinga templating.

These include:

The Base template threw up some issues regarding missing/stray tags but having double check I am satisfied that no tags are left open or missing. I believe this is again attributed to Jinga templating.

I am satisfied that the only remaining errors/warnings are in connected with Jinga templating so I have left unresolved.

# Errors/Warnings CSS <a name="css"></a>


My CSS was free of errors.

I had the following warning:

As this was part of the W3Schools tutorial and it was a warning as opposed to an error I have left this in place.
